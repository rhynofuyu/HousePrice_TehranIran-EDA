    "## 3. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the series of t-tests conducted, we can draw several key conclusions about the factors influencing house prices in Tehran:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Core Amenities are Crucial:** The presence of a **Parking**, **Warehouse**, or **Elevator** consistently and significantly increases the average price of a house. This suggests these are highly valued features in the Tehran real estate market.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Size Matters:**\n",
    "    *   **Area:** Larger houses (70-100m²) are significantly more expensive than smaller ones (<70m²), confirming that square meterage is a fundamental driver of price.\n",
    "    *   **Bedrooms:** An increase in the number of bedrooms generally leads to a higher price. Houses with 1, 3, 4, or 5 bedrooms are all significantly more expensive than studio apartments (0 bedrooms). The jump from 4 to 5 bedrooms also shows a significant price increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Contextual Importance:** The value of an amenity can be context-dependent. For example, an **elevator** provides a significant price premium even in **small houses (≤50m²)**, where one might not assume it's a standard feature. Similarly, **parking** remains a significant value driver even for **medium (81-120m²)** and **large (>200m²)** houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the most valuable properties in this dataset are large, have multiple bedrooms, and are equipped with essential amenities like parking, a warehouse, and an elevator."
